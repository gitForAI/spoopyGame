Spoopy Monster Game

Console output:

The human starts at position (0,0). The path should take the human to position (3,4). The console 
output shows that the A* algorithm that we implement generates a reasonable path to the goal by 
showing the x and y coordinates at each step of the path. The human ends at position (3,4) 
graphically (but this is also printed since this is difficult to eyeball).

Human start: x = 0, y = 0

PATH:

x = 0, y = 0

x = 0, y = 1

x = 0, y = 2

x = 0, y = 3

x = 0, y = 4

x = 1, y = 4

x = 2, y = 4

x = 3, y = 4

Human final: x = 3, y = 4
